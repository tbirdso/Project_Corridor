# Project_Corridor

Project Corridor is a virtual reality project that is designed to use voice controls as the primary game mechanic.

The goal of the game is to navigate a procedurally generated 3D space in virtual reality with the objective is to reach the end of the dungeon. The player can accomplish this by navigating through the space, solving puzzles and defeating enemies through the use of magic spells that can be used through voice commands. These voice commands will be randomized and unique upon each playthrough, and the voice commands will correspond to a different spell. These spells and the voice commands attatched to them will be able to be found in the space as the player navigates it. Each spell will have a different effect either on the player or the environment and will allow the player to combat enemies or solve puzzles.


Tom is in charge of developing the procedural generation of the map as well as the different possible layouts that the environment may have.

Jacob is in charge of creative design for the project and developing the possible interactions that the player can have with the space.

Colton is in charge of creating the spells and their effects, as well as developing the different map pieces that can be procedurally generated.

Aaron is in charge of the voice controls and having them cause the spells to occur, as well as have the spells be randomized upon each playthrough.
